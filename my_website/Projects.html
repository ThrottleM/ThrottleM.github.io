    <h1>This is where you can find my projects</h1>
    <p><font size="4">I will include a "Notes" section (mainly for my family) beneath each project to add context and explain additional details I think would help.</font></p>
    <p>You might notice that the term "Throttlem" and variations of it are being thrown around a bit in my things, the reason for that is it is my go-to username, which just so happens to sound strange without context.
    The context being that I wanted to make a videogame account one day when I was younger (around pre-middle school to in middle school) and thought that the username "Throttlemaster" sounded cool, but I didn't have enough characters, so I shortened it to "Throttlem", the name has stuck with me since (really just because I love the sound of it).    
    <p>My projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/176384631/">Starfish Choir Remix using the Scratch program</a>: The project is the program in the blue box, you click the creatures to play sounds. You can fullscreen the project by clicking the blue rectangle above the program's upper left corner, only on the project's webpage though, you can't fullscreen here ( I didn't choose to restrict it, I don't know why you can't).
      <br><font size=2><b>Notes: This project was a partner project by Bethany, who is, at the time of writing this, my table partner, and I.
      She had the project on her account, hence why it labels the "remixer" as "BethMae" (which is her username on Scratch). I have included the program below.</b></font>

    </li>
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177052143/#player">Original game made in Scratch:</a> A simple game where you play as a baby elephant trying to get to a mother elepehant, you press space to jump over the vines that block your way. After ten seconds of dodging vines, you win.You can play it below. Just click the green flag to start the game, and if you want, click it again to reset the game.
      <br><font size=2; color=crimson><b>Notes: This is another project made by Behtany and me in Scratch.
        You might noitce that the "remixer" is different this time, as instead of "BethMae", it is "ThrottleM", the reason for that is that the project file was on my account this time.
        Also, yes, whereas my partner has a understandable usernamne, mine is strange without context.
