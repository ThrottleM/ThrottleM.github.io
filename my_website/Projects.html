    <p><font size="4">I will include a "Notes" section (mainly for my family) beneath each project to add context and explain additional details I think would help.</font></p>
    <p>My projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/176384631/">Starfish Choir Remix using the Scratch program</a>: The project is the program in the blue box, you click the creatures to play sounds. You can fullscreen the project by clicking the blue rectangle above the program's upper left corner.
      <br><font size=2><b>Notes: This project was a partner project by Bethany, who is, at the time of writing this, my table partner, and I.
      She had the project on her account, hence why it labels the "remixer" as BethMae (which is her username on Scratch)</b></font></li>
    </ul>
