    <h1>This is where you can find my projects</h1>
    <p><font size="4">I will include a "Notes" section (mainly for my family) beneath each project to add context and explain additional details I think would help.</font></p>
    <p>You might notice that the term "Throttlem" and variations of it are being thrown around a bit in my things, the reason for that is it is my go-to username, which just so happens to sound strange without context.
    The context being that I wanted to make a videogame account one day when I was younger (around pre-middle school to in middle school) and thought that the username "Throttlemaster" sounded cool, but I didn't have enough characters, so I shortened it to "Throttlem", the name has stuck with me since (really just because I love the sound of it).    
    <p>My projects:</p>
    <ul>
    
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/176384631/" target="_blank">Starfish Choir Remix using the Scratch program</a>: The project is the program in the blue box, you click the creatures to play sounds. You can fullscreen the project by clicking the blue rectangle above the program's upper left corner, only on the project's webpage though, you can't fullscreen here ( I didn't choose to restrict it, I don't know why you can't).
      <br><font size=2><b>Notes: This project was a partner project by Bethany, who is, at the time of writing this, my table partner, and I.
      She had the project on her account, hence why it labels the "remixer" as "BethMae" (which is her username on Scratch). I have included the program below.</b></font>

    </li>
    
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177052143/#player" target="_blank">Original game made in Scratch:</a> A simple game where you play as a baby elephant trying to get to a mother elepehant, you press space to jump over the vines that block your way. After ten seconds of dodging vines, you win.You can play it below. Just click the green flag to start the game, and if you want, click it again to reset the game.
      <br><font size=2; color=crimson><b>Notes: This is another project made by Behtany and me in Scratch.
        You might noitce that the "remixer" is different this time, as instead of "BethMae", it is "ThrottleM", the reason for that is that the project file was on my account this time.
        Also, yes, whereas my partner has a understandable usernamne, mine is strange without context.

      <li>Text Based adventure:
      <br><a href="https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/spfbu7flfq10iwxiydyf" target="_blank">Gliffy flowchart</a>
      <br><a href="https://repl.it/NJaK/174" target="_blank">The actual text based adventure</a>
      <br><a href="Files/TBA.docx">Text based adventure storyline</a>
      <br><font size=2><b>Notes: Created by Jonathan and I in repl.it using the Python coding language. You might notice that the storyline is very different to the actual game, the reason for this is that, due to time constraints, I, who had been the main coder as Jonathan didn't have a computer to work on the game in personal time, had to greatly shorten the story to turn the project in on time to present it to the class.</font></b>
      </li><br>
      
      <li>App Remix:
      <br> This is an app that was modified from a template, in which you can take pictures, pick one, and post it to social media, text, or email with a generic caption.
      <br>Our modifications include: a more eye pleasing layout, an indicator of which picture has been chosen, the ability to make your own caption, and a modification of the system that stores the pictures.<br>

      <li>Utility:
      <br>This is an original app whose purpose is to be used as a sort of research tool, with three modes.<br> 
      <font color=red><br>Notes mode: you are given a webpage and a text box, which you can type in and save, side by side, in order to research and take notes simultaneously.
        This mode is pictured below.<br>
      <br>Canvas mode: it s the same as notes, but insetead of a text box, you are given a canvas, which you can doodle on.
        We wanted to make it so you could save your pictures like you could save your notes, but we couldn't figure out how to, so it can only be used to doodle right now.<br>
      <br>Web mode: this mode takes away the text box and canvas, and uses the empty space to increase the size of the webpage, giving you a better look at your research.</font><br>

      <li>Arduino:
      <br>This is a project we did using the Arduino Uno, a neat little machine that can be programmed to do lots of things.
